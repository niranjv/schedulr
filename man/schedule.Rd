\title{Find optimal schedule}
\usage{
schedule(job, deadline, cluster.instance.type, cluster.size, max.iter, max.temp)
}
\arguments{
\item{job}{Array of integers representing sizes of tasks in job}

\item{deadline}{Time (in seconds) by which job must be completed (integer)}

\item{cluster.instance.type}{Instance type of cluster (string). All instances in the cluster are assumed to have the same instance type}

\item{cluster.size}{Integer representing the number of instances in the cluster}

\item{max.iter}{Max number of iterations to use to find the optimal assignment (integer)}

\item{max.temp}{Max temperature to use in the simulated annealing process (flaot)}
}
\value{
A list representing the optimal assignment that could be found under the given constraints
}
\description{
Want an assignment with >= .95 probability of completing job by the deadline with the lowest makespan (cost)
}
\examples{
job <- c(1,60,100,100,100,230,400,800,2000,2700)
deadline <- 600

cluster.size <- 3
max.iter <- 100
max.temp <- 25
data(m3xlarge.runtimes.expdist)
setup.trainingset.runtimes('m3xlarge', m3xlarge.runtimes.expdist)
best.schedule <- schedule(job, deadline, cluster.instance.type, cluster.size, max.iter, max.temp)
